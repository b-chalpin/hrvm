//  ExportedEntities.swift
//  HRVMonitor WatchKit Extension
//
//  This Swift code file defines the ExportedEntities class for the HRVMonitor WatchKit Extension.
//  The ExportedEntities class is a data structure that contains entities that can be exported
//  from the app, such as patient settings, event items, logistic regression weights, logistic
//  regression data store, and HRV readings. This structure is particularly useful for exporting
//  and sharing data outside of the app in a standardized format.
